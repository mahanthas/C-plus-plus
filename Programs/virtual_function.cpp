/*
NOTES:
1. WHY to use virtual function?
   a. To achieve dynamic polymorphism. Which is the ability to call Derived class function using Base class pointer or reference.

2. HOW to use virtual function?
   a. By declaring function as virtual in Base class and overriding that function in Derived class.
      (Function signature should be same in Base and Dervied class)
   b. Declaring a function as virtual in Base class is enough, Derived class function need not to be declared virtual.
   c. Virtual functions should be accessed using pointer(*) or reference(&) of Base class type to achieve run time polymorphism.

ADITIONAL NOTES:
1. Virtual functions cannot be static and also cannot be a friend function of another class.
2. A class can have virtual destructor but can't have virtual constructor.
3. There are two types of virtual functions in C++.
   a. Virtual Function
   b. Pure Virtual Function
